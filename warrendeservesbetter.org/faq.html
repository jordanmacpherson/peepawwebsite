FAQs
Things you should know
Which is more prevalent? Charter or Statutory Govt.?
Charter is the most common form of government in cities our size. Statutory rules are over 100 yrs. old. Warren’s system of governing has become outdated. It needs updated to be competitive.

What’s wrong with a weak council (budgetary only)?
Currently, the local neighborhood councilman has no authority or oversight for delivery of services or quality to the residents.  

Can we still have a Mayor and a City Manager?
YES! Several cities have this form of government including Hudson, Kent, Obetz & Gahanna, OH.  

 Youngstown, Cleveland & Columbus are Charters 

with an elected mayor.



What other cities have Charter govt?
Most of them & Warren is only 1 of 6  cities with this population that is NOT a charter form of govt. 

What are the current qualifications to hold a “key position” in the city?
Be over 18.

Win an election

or be appointed. 

Be a resident. 

No education 

nor previous work

experience necessary.

How does a Charter help modernize Warren?
“Key” leadership roles in the city will require qualifications, certifications, experience in that field and licenses in order to apply. Qualified leadership seek the more “efficient & modern” ways to govern. Unqualified leadership maintains the “status quo” to hold on to positions. No qualifications means anyone can qualify. Unqualified leadership has to "outsource" the work they were hired to do. Outsourcing has cost the city MILLIONS of dollars (*Current Waste Water plant renovations will cost the city $14 mil dollars in consulting fees). 

Is charter a smarter and cheaper form of government?
It can be. Savings can be the consolidation of duplicate elected positions (*like Auditor & Treasurer). Safety-Service Director can become the City Manager. Mayor can be voted for by the city council. Could be the reduction of 3 to 6 positions making 3Xs more than a family in Warren.

What will be the difference of having 15 people on the “Charter Commission” compared to 11 Council members?
Warren citizens VOTE for the 15 member “temporary” Charter Commission; members are NOT appointed.  The 15 members are given the task of writing a Charter for the City of Warren which will have to be VOTED on by the residents.  This is the ONLY purpose of the Commission.

Is a Charter a Democratic or Republican initiative?
Neither. The Charter Initiative is a Bipartisan, grassroots & community driven initiative.  Members of the Charter Committee or Charter Commission can be Democrats, Republicans & Independents; not a “take over” by one party.  

It is an initiative so ALL residents can have more say in how the city operates.

What’s the difference between a Charter Committee and a Charter Commission?
Charter Committee: Residents of any political party that have agreed to monitor the petition drive to collect signatures to put the issue of “Should a Commission be chosen to Frame a Charter for Warren” on the ballot to be voted on by the residents.



Charter Commission: Will consist of 15 residents who run for and got voted on to the commission to write a Charter for the residents that will be put on the ballot to be voted on by the residents.

Who can run for the Charter Commission?
Any resident of the City of Warren.  Top 15 highest votes become the Commission 

to write the Charter.
