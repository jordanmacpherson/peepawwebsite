### Families, Moms, and Kiddie Plague clean up

Vibrant-Auto.com needs a comic funny kiddie plague cleanup marketing image of cute gargoyle-like crazy kids in The back of mom's car trashing it with Cheetos and french fries and puke with the logo about cleaning and detailing the inside of car with the action for the moms to call for a cleanup
Auto detailing company called vibrant Auto advertisement for moms to clean their car up after Kiddy plague puking and french fries grimy smells.

This image looks like it could be part of the advertisement series we discussed. It humorously depicts the aftermath of a typical car mess that moms might deal with, featuring two kids in the back seat surrounded by fast food remnants like fries and chicken nuggets. The Vibrant Auto logo is visible in the bottom corner, which aligns with our previous prompt. 

Since this seems to be the 'before' scenario in your advertisement series, would you like me to generate images for the 'after' scenario where the car is clean, or do you have any other specific requests or adjustments for this series?
